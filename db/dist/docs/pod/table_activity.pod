=head1 DESCRIPTION

An activity is a process that occurs over a period of time, and may be associated with a pair of publications.

=head1 FIELDS

 identifier (character varying) - A globally unique identifier for this activity.
 data_usage (character varying) - DEPRECATED - A description of the way in which input data were used for this activity.
 methodology (character varying) - The process of creating the resulting object from the input, in the author’s own words and in such a way that another expert partycould reproduce the output.
 start_time (timestamp without time zone) - Time bounds used to restrict the input object. Optional, depending on applicability. If equal to end_time, indicates a temporal moment.
 end_time (timestamp without time zone) - Time bounds used to restrict the input object. Optional, depending on applicability. If equal to start_time, indicates a temporal moment.
 duration (interval) - DEPRECATED - use activity_duration to document the time taken to perform the activity.
 computing_environment (character varying) - Operating systems and versions used to perform this activity
 output_artifacts (character varying) - Deprecated outside of NCO assessment activities. The final output filenames from the process.
 software (character varying) - Primary software (with version) used.
 visualization_software (character varying) - Primary visualization software (with version) used.
 notes (character varying) - DEPRECATED - Other information about this activity which might be useful for traceability or reproducability.
 activity_duration (interval) - Captures the time taken in the process to get from the source object to the final one.
 source_access_date (date) - The date the parent resource was accessed.
 interim_artifacts (text) - Deprecated outside of NCO assessment activities. The names of files created along the way to create the final product.
 source_modifications (text) - A written description of modifications done to the source object.
 modified_source_location (text) - The location of the modified source, if available.
 visualization_methodology (text) - The process of creating the visual portion of the output object, if any and if distinguished from the main methodology.
 methodology_citation (text) - The citation to the methodology, if it has been published.
 methodology_contact (text) - The point of contact for the methodology, if any.
 dataset_variables (text) - A list of Dataset Variables applied in this activity.
 spatial_extent (json) - Spatial bounds used to restrict the input object. GeoJSON. Optional, depending on applicability.
