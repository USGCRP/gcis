=head1 DESCRIPTION

A model run associates a model with a scenario and a project.

 range_start (date) - The start of time range convered by this model
 range_end (date) - The end of time range convered by this model
 sequence (integer) - An index distinguishing this run from other runs with similar parameters.
 sequence_description (character varying) - A description of how this run differs from others with similar parameters.
 activity_identifier (character varying) - An activity associated with this model run.
 project_identifier (character varying) - A project associated with this model.
 time_resolution (interval) - The temporal resolution of this run.
