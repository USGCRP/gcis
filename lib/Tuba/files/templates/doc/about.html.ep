    <center>About the Global Change Information System</center>
</h2>
<p>
The
<a href="http://www.globalchange.gov/about">US Global Change Research Program</a>
(USGCRP) has established the Global Change Information System (GCIS) to better coordinate and integrate the use of federal information products on changes in the global environment and the implications of those changes for society.
</p>
<p itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/WebApplication" itemprop="description">
The GCIS is an open-source, web-based resource for traceable, sound global change data, information, and products.
Designed for use by scientists, decision makers, and the public, the GCIS provides coordinated links to a select group of information
products produced, maintained, and disseminated by government agencies and organizations. As well as guiding users to global change research
products selected by the 13 member agencies, the GCIS serves as a key access point to assessments, reports, and tools produced
by the USGCRP. The GCIS is managed, integrated, and curated by USGCRP.
</p>

<h3>Global Change</h3>
<p>
For the purposes of the GCIS, “global change” refers to changes
in the global environment that may alter the
capacity of the Earth to sustain life. Global change encompasses climate
change, but it also includes other critical drivers of environmental change
that may interact with climate change, such as land use change, the
alteration of the water cycle, changes in biogeochemical cycles, and
biodiversity loss.
</p>
<p>
Global change information is structured using the <%= link_to 'resources' => begin %>GCIS data model<%= end %>;
this data model represents relationships and entities such
as reports, report chapters, figures, images, tables, bibliographic
entries, organizations and people.
<h3>Identifiers</h3>
<p>
Each item referenced in the GCIS has a unique, persistent identifier.  This identifer takes the form of a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), but may include or be related to other identifiers as well, such as Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs), Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs), ORCIds, and ISBNs.  Native identifiers for resources are incorporated in to the URI as much as possible to help with interoperability between the GCIS and other systems.
</p>

<h3>Provenance and Semantics</h3>
<p>
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) definition of provenance,
"... information about entities, activities, and people involved in
producing a piece of data or thing, which can be used to form assessments
about its quality, reliability or trustworthiness ..." (W3C 2013),
is the basis for the representation of provenance within the GCIS.
Relationships between URIs within the GCIS are represented in a triple
store.  A <%= link_to '/sparql' => begin %>SPARQL endpoint<%= end %>
allows this triple store to be queried, as described in these
<%= link_to '/examples' => begin %>examples<%= end %>.
</p>

<h3>GCIS Development Effort</h3>
<p>GCIS is written in <a href="http://perl.org">Perl</a> using the <a href="http://mojolicio.us">mojolicious</a> web framework
and uses many fine modules from the <a href="http://metacpan.org">CPAN</a>.
It relies on <a href="http://postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a> for data storage, and populates
a <a href="http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com">Virtuoso</a> triple store.</p>
